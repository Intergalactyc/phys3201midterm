This repo contains:
- csv file of data used in report
- figure used in report
- code

If the code is run, it will check to see if there is a dataset named "happiness.csv" in its containing folder.
If there is, it runs based off of this data; if not, it generates a new dataset and saves it to file.
Hence, running the code with the provided dataset will reproduce the results of the report.
